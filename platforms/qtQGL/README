README for v3dfx-base [PLATFORM - QT] class (QGLWidget based)
================================================================

INTRODUCTION:

This implementation exposes video streaming functionality 
via SGX GPU, wrapped in a Qt widget

This implementation provides V3dfxGLWidget in libv3dfx_qt.so, 
that can be used by other Qt applications.

STATUS:
Working (the QGLWidget class).

DEPENDENCIES:

=> Qt built with -opengl es2 option
=> v3dfx base-class should have been built (v3dfx-base.a)
=> TI Graphics SDK with imgstream and/or eglimage extension support

TESTING:

==> Tested on Qt4.8 QWS, on DM3730 EVM

STEPS:

1. Update v3dfx_qt.pro as required (paths)

2. Use qmake to generate the Qt makefile for this project, as below

~/work1/arm-qt/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.0/bin/qmake -o Makefile v3dfx_qt.pro

3. make && make install

4. Test this using qt-v3dfx-base-test (under /test/platforms/qt)
