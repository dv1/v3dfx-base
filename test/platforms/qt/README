README for v3dfx-base-test [PLATFORM - QT] test application
================================================================

INTRODUCTION:

This implementation tests video streaming functionality 
via SGX GPU, using V3dfxGLWidget. This draws YUV data into
a GraphicsView, with V3dfxGLWidget as a ViewPort. Other forms
of usage of V3dfxGLWidget are possible, but not tested or supported

DEPENDENCIES:

=> Qt built with -opengl es2 option
=> TI Graphics SDK with imgstream and/or eglimage extension support
=> v3dfx base-class should have been built (v3dfx-base.a)
=> V3dfxGLWidget should be built (/platforms/qt)

TESTING:

==> Tested on Qt4.8 QWS, on DM3730 EVM

STEPS:

1. Update qt-v3dfx-base-test.pro as required (paths)

2. Use qmake to generate the Qt makefile for this project, as below

~/work1/arm-qt/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.0/bin/qmake -o Makefile qt-v3dfx-base-test.pro

3. make && make install

4. Test this using qt-v3dfx-base-test
